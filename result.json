This assessment called Career Leader is considered by many as the top assessment for business related careers. It was developed by professors at Harvard Business School and is used by many of the top schools in the country. Career Leader will measure your Interests, Skills, and Motivators and match these with potential job types.</li>\n<li>To simplify the process of ordering while allowing you to quickly complete the assessment we have arranged with the BYU Idaho bookstore to have your student financial account charged&nbsp;$20.00 after the add/drop date. The normal price for this assessment is more&mdash;you are receiving a student discount. <strong>If you have already taken the Career Leader assessment in a prior class please let your instructor know early in the semester to avoid having your account charged a second time.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><em> <strong>&nbsp;There is also an additional class fee of $8 included in tuition.</strong></em>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Key Questions to Help Determine Career Direction</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Where are my interests? What do I like to do?</li>\n<li>What am I good at? What are my skills? What are my aptitudes?</li>\n<li>What areas will provide for my needs and the needs of my family? What areas will provide the needed economic security?</li>\n<li>What careers would fit my faith and allow me to serve God, as I would desire?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Course Expectations</h2>\n<h3>Portfolio&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>One key learning objective in this course is to allow you to practice and improve on your time management skills. Throughout the course you will be putting together pieces of this portfolio. Although weekly assignments are designed to help emphasize key part within the portfolio, any assignment that is directly part of the portfolio will only be submitted with the corresponding part&nbsp;of the portfolio. If you stay on top of each item each week you should have no problem submitting a completed portfolio. Your ability to manage your time wisely will be important both for this assignment as well as the rest of your career.</p>\n<p><strong>The portfolio is worth 65% of your grade.</strong></p>\n<p>Since this portfolio assignment is such an important component to this course we want to ensure you have every opportunity to be successful so we have broken it up in two parts:</p>\n<p><em> <strong> <u>Part 01 will be submitted at the conclusion of Lesson 05: Info. Systems</u> </strong> </em></p>\n<p><em> <strong> <u>Part 02 &amp; 03 will be submitted at the conclusion of Lesson 10: Portfolio Due</u> </strong> </em></p>\n<p>Since there are a number of assignments contained within the portfolio it is incumbent upon you to review the detailed instructions to ensure you are clear about what is expected. You will notice that the portfolio has three sections - all sections are required to get full credit.</p>\n<h3>Networking Preparation</h3>\n<p>Networking is vital to a successful career. In this course you will prepare to network by completing the following three activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting up a LinkedIn profile and then making at least 20 connections and joining at least three groups</li>\n<li>Writing your own &ldquo;Me in 30 Seconds&rdquo; statement</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Points will be deducted for a poorly written or incorrect &ldquo;Me in 30 Seconds&rdquo; statement.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Completing a resume review through Academic Discovery Center</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Academic/Graduation Plan&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Success in business comes when a plan is developed and a clear path is in place to achieve ones goals. Your Academic/Graduation Plan is a tool to help you clearly see what you need to do in order to become a BYU‐Idaho&nbsp;Graduate/Alumni. You will need to ensure that you have laid out your four‐year plan with help from&nbsp;the Academic Discovery Center (ADC). Once this is completed, you want to be sure and get the plan approved through the ADC. Both a copy of your plan and the approval will be included in your portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Resume review</h3>\n<p>You will need to either prepare or update your resume that will be reviewed by Career Services.</p>\n<p>To sign up for the resume review go to:<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local/Rexburg: <a href=\"http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers/writing/make-an-appointment\">http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers/writing/make-an-appointment</a></li>\n<li>Not in Rexburg:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers/writing/help-for-online-students\">http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers/writing/help-for-online-students</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Schedule the review early in the semester as it gets difficult to get an appointment toward the end of the semester.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers/writing/help-for-online-students\"><!--EndFragment--> </a></p>\n<p><strong> <em>Note: </em> </strong> <em>Do not wait until the end of the semester to complete this assignment. You might find that they do not have slots available. A resume review with Career Services is required to pass the class.</em>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Portfolio Assignment Substitution Opportunity</h3>\n<p>If you are working full‐time and are not looking to switch careers, you may be able to substitute items for key assignments within the portfolio. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Industry and company analysis Career Leader Assessment</li>\n<li>Resume review</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You must contact your instructor before the end of lesson 2 to be eligible to be excused from these activities. If you do not contact your instructor by this time and receive approval to skip these assignments you will be responsible to complete them as part of the portfolio.</strong></p>\n<h3>Discussion Boards</h3>\n<p>The ability to engage with both classmates and your instructor is a key component to the learning model at BYU‐I. One of the best ways to allow this to happen is by the use of Discussion Boards. Each discussion board provides the opportunity for you to share your personal thoughts and insights as well as engaging with your classmates by commenting on their posts and asking questions. The discussion boards will take place during the following weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction week: Ice Breaker</li>\n<li>Lesson 3</li>\n<li>Lesson 6</li>\n<li>Lesson 11</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each discussion board your instructor will post the question by Monday morning of the week it is due. You will need to post your initial response by <strong>Wedne</strong><strong>sday at 11 PM&nbsp;</strong>of that week. Then you will need to respond to a minimum of a least two other classmates by <strong>Saturday at 11 PM</strong>. Understand that the&nbsp;minimum of two posts does not mean you will get full credit. Since student-to-student interaction is so important to the learning model, going beyond the two minimum will ensure full credit. Points will be deducted for posts that do not address all the questions, do not demonstrate appropriate effort in answering, or that have spelling and grammar errors.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Key Business Understanding</h3>\n<p>Understanding the role and key definitions from key business areas is essential to understanding the industry. There is not enough time within this class to go over all terms for each topic we will be covering. However, we do want you to have a good base understanding of key terms that will help you in business. There will be a Key Business Term Exam that can be taken as many times as needed during the week it is available. Although you can take it as many times as you need during the week, the test is <u>not </u>open note.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Board of Review</h3>\n<p>During the final two weeks of the semester you will be required to take part in a board of review session with your instructor to discuss your key learnings and take-a-ways from the course. Your instructor will provide more detailed information on both the process of signing up for a time as well as the expectations for your session. It will be important that you are prepared for this board of review since it will be a part of your overall grade.</p>\n<p><em><strong> Note:&nbsp; </strong>While the Board of Review will be held during the final two weeks of the semester you only need to participate one of the weeks.</em></p>\n<h2>Overall Course Grading</h2>\n<p>Your grade will be based on the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Portfolio part 1: 25%</li>\n<li>Portfolio parts 2-3: 40%</li>\n<li>Weekly assignments (including weekly assessment, discussion boards, etc.): 15%</li>\n<li>Key business terms exam: 10%</li>\n<li>Board of review: 10%</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Important Reminders</h2>\n<h3>Workload</h3>\n<p>The workload will be heavier than most one credit courses you may have taken and will require you to take initiative to complete assignments. You will want to plan on spending approximately 3 hours a week outside of class to do well in the course.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Late Work</h3>\n<p>It is critical that you do not fall behind in your weekly and portfolio assignments, plan ahead. All assignments and due dates are listed in the weekly overviews. <strong>Turning work in on time is a sign of professionalism.</strong></p>\n<h2>University Policies</h2>\n<p>One of the major goals at BYU‐Idaho is that of providing quality educational opportunities in a rich spiritual&nbsp;environment. To obtain this desired level of spiritual influence, students are asked to observe all points of the Code of Honor including the dress and grooming standards.&nbsp;We take this opportunity to remind you of the commitment you made to live the Code of Honor when you signed your application form to BYU‐Idaho.&nbsp;In all of your BYU‐I classes you are expected to observe the Code of Honor. Be sure you review the honor code, Dress &amp; Grooming and Student Life links below to ensure you are clear on the expectations from BYU‐I.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Honor Code</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dress &amp; Grooming</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Student Life</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Disability Services</h3>\n<p>In compliance with applicable disability law, qualified students with a disability maybe entitled to a reasonable accommodation. It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to disclose to the teacher any special need he or she may have before the end of the first week of class. In order for students to qualify for a reasonable&nbsp;&nbsp; accommodation, they must contact</p>\n<h3>Title IX‐Sexual Harassment</h3>\n<p>Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment may include 1) unwelcome sexual advances, 2) requests for sexual favors, and 3) other verbal, non‐verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment may also include denying or limiting, on the basis of sex, the student&rsquo;s ability to participate in or receive benefits, services, or opportunities in university programs. BYU‐ Idaho&rsquo;s policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employment situations but to academic situations as well.</p>\n<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>\n<p>All BYU‐Idaho Instructors expect the highest levels of academic integrity from their students. Those failing to demonstrate academic integrity will be referred to the Dean of Students office and discipline from their instructor may include any or all of the following: Reading/writing assignments to teach, failure on the assignment/exam, failure in the class, and/or a service/learning experience. The university policy regarding academic integrity is listed below.</p>\n<h3>Academic Honesty Policy &ndash; Definitions</h3>\n<p><strong>Intentional Plagiarism </strong>is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one&rsquo;s&nbsp;own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference or footnote.&nbsp; <strong>Inadvertent Plagiarism</strong> involves the inappropriate, but non-&shy;‐ deliberate, use of another&rsquo;s words, ideas or data without proper attribution. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, it is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance.&nbsp; <strong>Plagiarism</strong> may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. &nbsp;Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><u>Direct Plagiarism</u>&mdash;the verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source.</li>\n<li><u>Paraphrased Plagiarism</u>&mdash;the paraphrasing, without acknowledgment, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author&rsquo;s own.</li>\n<li><u>Plagiarism Mosaic</u>&mdash;the borrowing of words, ideas or data from an original source and blending this original material with one&rsquo;s own without acknowledging the source.</li>\n<li><u>Insufficient Acknowledgement</u>&mdash;the partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas or data from an original source.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fabrication or Falsification </strong>is a form of dishonesty where a student invents or distorts the origin or content of information used as authority. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Citing a source that does not exist.</li>\n<li>Citing information from a source that is not included in the source for which credit is given Citing a source for a secondary proposition that it does not support.</li>\n<li>Citing a bibliography source when it was neither consulted nor cited in the body of the paper Intentionally distorting the meaning or applicability of data.</li>\n<li>Inventing data or statistical results to support conclusions.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cheating </strong>is a form of dishonesty where a student attempts to give the appearance of a level of knowledge or skill that has not been obtained. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copying from another person&rsquo;s work during an examination or while completing an assignment allowing someone to copy from you during an examination or while completing an assignment Using unauthorized materials during an examination or while completing an assignment.</li>\n<li>Collaborating on an examination or assignment without authorization.</li>\n<li>Taking an examination or completing an assignment for another, or permitting another to take an examination or to complete an assignment for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other Academic Misconduct </strong>includes other academically dishonest, deceitful or inappropriate acts that are intentionally committed. Examples include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inappropriately providing or receiving information or academic work so as to gain unfair advantage over&nbsp;others.</li>\n<li>Planning with another to commit any act of academic dishonesty.</li>\n<li>Attempting to gain an unfair academic advantage for oneself or another by bribery or by any act of offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting anything of value to another for such purpose.</li>\n<li>Changing or altering grades or other official educational records.</li>\n<li>Obtaining or providing to another a test or answers to a test which has not been administered Breaking and entering into a building or office for the purpose of obtaining an unauthorized test Continuing work on an examination or assignment after the allocated time has elapsed.</li>\n<li>Submitting the same work for more than one class without disclosure and approval Getting equal credit on group assignments when equal work was not done.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Academic Honesty Policy &ndash; Adjudication Procedures</h3>\n<p>Faculty members are responsible to establish and communicate to students their expectations of behavior with respect to academic honesty and the student&rsquo;s conduct in their course. The instructor will be responsible to investigate any incident of academic dishonesty or misconduct, determine the circumstances, and take appropriate action. Examples include but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reprimanding the student orally or in writing.</li>\n<li>Requiring work affected by the academic dishonesty to be redone.</li>\n<li>Administering a lower or failing grade on the affected assignment, test, or course Work with the Dean of Students to remove the student from the course.</li>\n<li>Recommending to the Dean of Students that the student be put on probation or dismissed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the incident involves the violation of a public law, e.g., breaking and entering into an office or stealing an examination, the act should be reported to University Police. For the purpose of tracking, suspected or proven violations of the Academic Honesty Policy should be reported to the Dean of Students office&mdash;name, incident, action taken. If the occurrence is sufficiently egregious or if a pattern of dishonesty or misconduct is discovered additional action may be taken on behalf of the university based upon the nature of the infraction. If an affected student disagrees with the determination or action and is unable to resolve the matter to the mutual satisfaction of the student and the instructor, he/she may have it reviewed through the university&rsquo;s grievance process.</p>\n<p><strong> <em>This syllabus is subject to change, based on the demands (learning or otherwise) of this course, the university, and the students in the class.

Please take some time to review the <a href=\"/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=237861&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_production-1137022\" target=\"_blank\">Syllabus</a>&nbsp;and become familiar with the course. The information below provides useful details regarding department policies and the course itself.</p>\n<h2>Instructor Role</h2>\n<p>The Instructor role in B 100 is a very limited scope of responsibilities. Students need to be notified on the Questions and Conversations Discussion Board on which assignments are coming up during the week and any additional resources they deem valuable for the topic of that specific week. Monitor and facilitate the Questions and Conversations Discussion Board throughout the week and do your best to answer to the concerns of the students.</p>\n<p>Please review the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fXW5sSMi-9TtXNyVOcZe8Ff2wr8-5RC91UrK0nSPyvQ/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Course Map</a>&nbsp;to view the time and role expectations for each activity. The Course Map is organized by lesson and should be a helpful tool as you plan your time.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>I-Learn Resources</h2>\n<p>You may utilize any of the resources below to find answers to your I-Learn questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/14177/m/53637\" target=\"_blank\">I-Learn 3.0 Help Guides</a>&nbsp;are available for self-study and reference.</li>\n<li>Contact the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://content.byui.edu/integ/gen/8872d2b2-91d5-4953-a357-3097ef2aa5d0/0/byuisupcenter.html\" target=\"_blank\">Online Support Center</a><span style=\"color: #b60c0d;\">&nbsp;</span>to ask a question or report a problem.</li>\n<li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://onlineinstruction.ning.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Online Instructor Community</a>&nbsp;is an additional resource.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Grading Policy</h2>\n<p>This course is graded in weighted categories, which means that students receive&nbsp;points for assignments that they complete, and those points go towards the selective category. Each category is weighted separately, so a specific assignment grade that pertains to one category goes to that distinctive category.</p>\n<p>The categories are: Weekly Assignments, Board of Review, Portfolio Part 1, Portfolio Part 02 and 03, and Key Business Terms Exam. &nbsp;The grade items that are not in a category are part of the Final Calculated grade, the students cannot see these items which means the grade they receive is reflective of the progress and effort in the course.</p>\n<p>In Weekly Assignments there are quizzes titled \"Lxx Weekly Reflection\" and they have a special grading process that you should pay attention to in the Specific Lesson Notes.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about the University's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system\" target=\"_blank\">Grading System</a>, refer to their website for guidance.</p>\n<h3>Due Dates</h3>\n<p>All assignments are due either Wednesday or Saturday.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discussion boards: &nbsp;Wednesday 11:00pm (initial post) and Saturday 11:00pm (follow-up posts).</li>\n<li>Weekly reflections and other \"required\" weekly assignments: Saturday 11:00pm.</li>\n<li>Portfolio: Saturday of Week 5 and 10 at 11:00pm.</li>\n<li>Key Business Terms Exam: &nbsp;Saturday of Week 11 at 11:00pm (students can take this exam as many times as they want during week 11).</li>\n<li>Board of Review: &nbsp;Week 12 or 13. &nbsp;Students sign up on a Google Doc that you create. You can choose to have the board of review as a group conference call format or one-on-one. &nbsp;If necessary, conferences can be conducted via a discussion board - but this is the least desirable option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Late Work Policy</h3>\n<p>Students should complete their work on time, but as instructor you have discretion to accept late work or extend due dates. It is strongly encouraged that you not extend the deadline for the portfolio. &nbsp;The on-campus classes of B100 have a very strict deadline. &nbsp;Students who fail to meet that deadline fail the class. &nbsp;We can be somewhat flexible in the event of technical issues but otherwise we need to be just as strict in our deadlines. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Retries</h3>\n<p>The syllabus quiz in Lesson 01 has an unlimited amount of attempts. However, this is the only quiz that is set up that way. All other \"Weekly Reflection\" quizzes have one attempt. No other special circumstances apply to this course.</p>\n<h2>Groups</h2>\n<p>Students are not organized into groups in this course - although some instructors have found it helpful to organize groups according to work experience..</p>\n<h2>Pre-Semester Setup</h2>\n<p>Please complete the <a href=\"/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=237861&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-21457\" target=\"_blank\">Setup For Course Instructor</a>&nbsp;if you have not done so already.</p>\n<h2>Other Topics</h2>\n<p>Many teachers have found it very useful to create a weekly podcast or video message to send to the students. The content of these varies but it should an overview of the business focus area&nbsp;for the week (for example if the students are discussing Accounting, provide your perspective on the accounting industry), a discussion on the key business terms for that week, and the recommended portfolio assignments to complete that week. &nbsp;It is also helpful to show them where the reading and video content is located. &nbsp; Another way to accomplish this is by recording the Office Hours sessions through Adobe Connect and sending the link to the students.</p>\n<h2>Course Maintenance</h2>\n<h3>Fixes</h3>\n<p>A fix is a correction to errors in course content or design that may have appeared through human error. Even though errors may be identified by any instructor, many fixes will need approval by the Online Course Representative (OCR) before they are implemented. The OCR is familiar enough with both course function and design to recognize and know the proper fix for mechanical and content errors. Examples of fixes include broken links, date changes, grammar/spelling errors, and audio/video issues.</p>\n<p>To submit a fix ticket, use the Course Fixes and Improvements form located in the Instructor Resources folder. Once a ticket is received, Course Improvement employees will update the Reference course for next semester. You might need to make the corrections to your current section. Course Improvement and your OCR can help you make those corrections, if needed.</p>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<p>An improvement is a suggested change that did not exist in the initial design of the course. It requires review by and approval from the Course Lead (CL) and the OCR before Course Maintenance can implement it in the course. These changes are usually large-scale and frequently require more time to implement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have ideas for improving an assignment, instructions, grading rubric, groups, etc. please send your idea to your OCR for consideration. Please do not make these changes in your section, as they need to be discussed by the course council. Those ideas which are approved and authorized will then be implemented in the course.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Instructor Assessment Considerations</h2>\n<p>The table below notes any unique course features and their impact on your instructor assessments/TGL course visits.

If used correctly, these questions can become powerful tools in the learning process. Your students will learn best as they analyze, review the materials they are learning, and develop new ideas and ways of personal application with those materials.</p>\n<p>In your course, you will have many opportunities to ask deep, thought provoking questions. For example, when leading discussions in discussion boards, you can start a thread by posting a deep question. Deep follow-up questions to their responses will also foster learning. Though discussion boards may be the most obvious place to ask deep questions, you may also have opportunities to do so in office hours, emails, and other communication with students.</p>\n<p>The BYU&ndash;Idaho Learning Model clearly defines the process that students and teachers should experience while here at BYU&ndash;Idaho. The steps in that process are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Preparation</li>\n<li>Teach One Another</li>\n<li>Ponder/Prove</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following guidelines help to provide opportunities where students can ponder and prove the materials they are learning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Convergent Thinking Questions</strong>&nbsp;usually begin with:\n<ul>\n<li>Why...</li>\n<li>How...</li>\n<li>In what ways...</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Divergent Thinking Questions</strong>&nbsp;usually begin with:\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine...</li>\n<li>Suppose...</li>\n<li>Predict...</li>\n<li>If..., then...</li>\n<li>How might...</li>\n<li>Can you create...</li>\n<li>What are some possible consequences...</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluative Thinking Questions</strong>&nbsp;usually begin with these words or phrases:\n<ul>\n<li>Defend...</li>\n<li>Judge...</li>\n<li>Justify...</li>\n<li>What do you think about...</li>\n<li>What is your opinion about...</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following material contains good examples and insight on asking effective questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Help students build explanations by asking and answering deep questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When students have acquired a basic set of knowledge about a particular topic of study and are ready to build a more complex understanding of a topic, we recommend that teachers find opportunities to ask questions and model answers to these questions, in order to help students build deep explanations of key concepts. By deep explanations, we mean explanations that appeal to causal mechanisms, planning, well-reasoned arguments, and logic. Examples of deep explanations include those that inquire about causes and consequences of historical events, motivations of people involved in historical events, scientific evidence for particular theories, and logical justifications for the steps of a mathematical proof. Examples of the types of questions that prompt deep explanations are why, why-not, how, what-if, how does X compare to Y, and what is the evidence for X?These questions and explanations occur during classroom instruction, class discussion, and during independent study.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Organizing Instruction and Study to Improve Student Learning, pgs. 29&ndash;31</p>\n<p>Here is the link to the website to download a copy of the <a title=\"full document\" href=\"http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide.aspx?sid=1\" target=\"_blank\">Practice Guide</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- end #article --></div>\n<script src=\"Web%20Files/course.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>"],

Bednar</h2>\n<p><strong>Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho Devotional</strong></p>\n<p><strong>August 31, 2004</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to meet and worship with you this afternoon. I pray for and invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost as together we consider some of the remarkable events that are taking place on the campus of Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho.</p>\n<p>After returning home from their missions, each of our sons has been blessed to teach in the missionary training center in Provo. Because of their experiences at the MTC, and because of my service as a Seventy, whenever we are all together we invariably end up talking about what is happening at the MTC, about missions and missionaries and missionary work, and about what and how the new elders and sisters are being trained and taught.</p>\n<p>As we recently were together talking about the MTC, I began to think about the 17 missionary training centers that are located throughout the world. It occurred to me that all of the missionary training centers have the following characteristics in common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The missionary training centers are rather isolated geographically and are few in number.</li>\n<li>Missionaries reside and study in the MTC for relatively short periods of time.</li>\n<li>The nature of the instruction in the MTCs is focused and intense.</li>\n<li>There are in the MTCs distinctive requirements for demeanor and dress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now please pay particular attention to this next characteristic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most missionary training centers are located near a temple.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I considered these similarities, I was struck by the fact that Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho in Rexburg possesses these same characteristics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BYU&ndash;Idaho is located in a rather isolated geographic area.</li>\n<li>By and large, students are enrolled at BYU&ndash;Idaho for a relatively short period of time.</li>\n<li>The learning and teaching processes at BYU&ndash;Idaho are focused and intense.</li>\n<li>There is at BYU&ndash;Idaho a distinguishing standard of deportment and dress.</li>\n<li>And as was announced by the First Presidency last December, BYU&ndash;Idaho will soon be adjacent to a temple.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Brothers and sisters, it should be obvious to all of us that something spiritually significant is taking place in Rexburg, Idaho. The announcement in June of 2000 that Ricks College would become Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho was much more than the establishing of a new baccalaureate degree granting institution. The addition of new faculty and other employees is not simply about covering classes and meeting staffing needs. The construction on and remodeling of this campus are about so much more than new laboratories and classrooms and study areas.</p>\n<p>Let me suggest that in Rexburg, Idaho, we are in the process of creating not a missionary training center (MTC), but a Disciple Preparation Center&mdash;a DPC. In this special and sacred and set apart place, you and I have access to unparalleled spiritual resources that can assist us in developing and deepening our devotion as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the primary and most important reason for the existence of Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho and for its sponsorship by and affiliation with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>\n<h2>A Disciple Preparation Center (DPC)</h2>\n<p>Let us now pay particular attention to the three words that make up the phrase I just introduced: disciple, preparation, and center.</p>\n<p>A <strong>disciple</strong> is one who follows or attends upon another for the express purpose of learning (Oxford English Dictionary On-Line, second edition, 1989). Please note that a disciple both follows and learns, as the following scriptures highlight:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;I am the light of the world: he that <strong><em>followeth me</em></strong> shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. (John 8:12; emphasis added)</p>\n<p>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>\n<p>Take my yoke upon you, and <strong><em>learn of me</em>;</strong> for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>\n<p>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (Matthew 11:28-30; emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, a disciple of Christ is a follower of Jesus who learns of and from Him and lives according to His teachings. As we learn in Doctrine and Covenants 41:5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and shall be cast out from among you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A disciple of Christ is one who is following and learning to be like Christ&mdash;learning to think, to feel, and to act as He does. He or she is striving to gain \"&hellip;the mind of Christ\" (1 Corinthians 2:16). Becoming a true disciple of the Savior and following His ways are the most demanding learning objectives we can ever strive to achieve. No other discipline compares with His curriculum in either requirements or rewards. Discipleship demands the total transformation of a person by putting off the natural man and becoming a saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord (see Mosiah 3:19). A disciple is one who loves the Lord and serves Him with all of his or her heart, might, mind, and strength.</p>\n<p>The word <strong>preparation</strong> implies the process of making or getting ready; the previous putting or setting in order for any action or purpose (Oxford English Dictionary On-Line, second edition, 1989). And one of the common uses of the word <strong>center</strong> connotes a point from which things and influences originate or emanate (Oxford English Dictionary On-Line, second edition, 1989). Taken together, these three words, disciple preparation center, suggest to me a place in which followers of the Master learn and are set in order and are made ready&mdash;and from which their influence flows into the world.</p>\n<p>What is it that makes this campus such a powerful Disciple Preparation Center (DPC)? Let me suggest three factors that contribute to the spiritual strength that is available here. (1) This institution of higher education is a temple of learning; (2) this institution will be located next to a holy temple, even a House of the Lord; and (3) this institution is surrounded by strong stakes of Zion.</p>\n<h3>Factor #1: BYU&ndash;Idaho is a temple of learning.</h3>\n<p>Our daughter-in-law, Charlotte, graduated from the nursing program at BYU&ndash;Provo in April of 2003. Our family was delighted to attend her graduation ceremony and to celebrate her accomplishment.</p>\n<p>Over the years of our service together, I have developed a great affection for and relationship with Elder Merrill Bateman; and I knew this graduation ceremony was to be his final commencement as the president of that institution. So I listened with particular attention to his message to the graduates. I was most intrigued by his use of a verse from Isaiah and his explication of that verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>\n<p>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. (Isaiah 2:2&ndash;3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elder Bateman then proceeded to describe how the instructional facilities on the campuses of the universities affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been dedicated to the God of Jacob and are a portion of what is referred to in Isaiah&mdash;a part of the Lord's house that has been established in the tops of the mountains wherein He will teach us of His ways. Now, we all know that these verses refer to the House of the Lord, to the holy temples. But what came into my mind as I listened to Elder Bateman was this thought: we are blessed to have the House of the Lord, and we also are blessed to have temples of learning.</p>\n<p>BYU&ndash;Idaho, brothers and sisters, is a temple of learning. I have tried to use that phrase carefully so as to not confuse the House of the Lord with a temple of learning. But there are important patterns and parallels between the House of the Lord and temples of learning, with temples of learning referring specifically to the institutions of higher education sponsored by and affiliated with the Church.</p>\n<p>In both the House of the Lord and in the temples of learning, a standard of worthiness must be met in order to enter and to learn what is being taught. For a member who desires a temple recommend and for a student who wishes to enter into one of the temples of learning, there is a standard of worthiness.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, in both the holy temple and in temples of learning, a significant personal commitment is linked to the learning process. Consider, brothers and sisters, that in the House of the Lord we come under covenant and bind ourselves to act in all holiness. In a similar way, students who are admitted to study and learn in the temples of learning make a commitment to keep the commandments of God and to abide by the university honor and dress codes. Thus, covenants and commitments expand our education in the House of the Lord and in the Church's temples of learning.</p>\n<p>In both the House of the Lord and in a temple of learning, as a result of what we experience and what we learn and what we feel, we then strive to heed a higher standard. That is the outcome and the result of what we learn. Consequently, we prepare a little harder, dress a little nicer, act a little better, and think more deeply about things that really matter.</p>\n<p>Please turn with me to Doctrine and Covenants 97:1&ndash;3. Parley P. Pratt had the responsibility in Kirtland at this time to direct the school of the Elders and to assist the elders in preparing for the work of proclaiming the gospel. I draw your attention to verses 1, 2, and 3&mdash;with particular emphasis on verse 3. Think in terms of this institution as a temple of learning as we read these verses together.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verily I say unto you my friends, I speak unto you with my voice, even the voice of my Spirit, that I may show unto you my will concerning your brethren in the land of Zion, many of whom are truly humble and are seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to find truth.</p>\n<p>Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such, for they shall obtain; for I, the Lord, show mercy unto all the meek, and upon all whomsoever I will, that I may be justified when I shall bring them unto judgment.</p>\n<p>Behold, I say unto you, concerning the school in Zion, I, the Lord, am well pleased that there should be a school in Zion&hellip; (emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this school in Zion in Rexburg&mdash;in this temple of learning&mdash;disciples can follow the Savior and learn of and from Him the lessons that will prepare them for effective service in their homes, in the Church, and in their communities and careers.</p>\n<h3>Factor #2: BYU&ndash;Idaho will be located next to a House of the Lord.</h3>\n<p>Let us now focus on the second key factor that contributes to the spiritual strength that is available in this Disciple Preparation Center. Section 97 of the Doctrine and Covenants, from which we have just read, highlights the importance of both a school in Zion and of the holy temple. Please now turn with me to verse 10:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that a house should be built unto me in the land of Zion, like unto the pattern which I have given you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Verses 13&ndash;14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For a place of thanksgiving for all saints, and for a place of instruction for all those who are called to the work of the ministry in all their several callings and offices;</p>\n<p>That they may be perfected in the understanding of their ministry, in theory, in principle, and in doctrine, in all things pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth, the keys of which kingdom have been conferred upon you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And verse 16:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it, and all the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God. (Doctrine and Covenants 97:10, 13&ndash;14, 16)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the time of his call to become the fourteenth president of the Church, President Howard W. Hunter issued an invitation for \"&hellip; all members of the Church to establish the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of their membership and the supernal setting for their most sacred covenants\" (Howard W. Hunter, \"The Great Symbol of Our Membership,\" <em>Ensign</em>, October 1994, p. 2). Brothers and sisters, temples are holy; temples are sacred places for learning about and entering into eternal covenants; temples are places of peace and of revelation. Temples are eternal links: between heaven and earth; between past, present, and future; between the living and the dead; between time and eternity; between husbands and wives, parents and children; and between men and women with Christ. It is in the House of the Lord that things of the earth are joined with the things of heaven.</p>\n<p>Now please consider the spiritual significance of having a House of the Lord on the campus of Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho. Ponder the impact of a holy temple on the campus of this school in Zion.</p>\n<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley has taught:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every temple that this Church has built has in effect stood as a monument to our belief in the immortality of the human soul, that this phase of mortal life through which we pass is part of a continuous upward climb . . . and that as certain as there is life here, there will be life there. That is our firm belief. It comes about through the Atonement of the Savior, and the temple becomes . . . the bridge from this life to the next. The temple is concerned with things of immortality. We wouldn't have to build a temple for marriages if we didn't believe in the eternity of the family. We build it so the family may be eternal. All of the ordinances which take place in the house of the Lord become expressions of our belief in that fundamental and basic doctrine. The temple therefore becomes the ultimate in our system of worship and therefore is of great and significant importance to us. (Gordon B. Hinckley, \"Inspirational Thoughts,\" <em>Ensign</em>, April 2002, p. 3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The temple as a quiet but consistent reminder in our midst of the centrality of Jesus Christ and of the immortality of the soul cannot but elevate the quality of our education and the depth and beauty of our associations.</p>\n<p>Several years ago, Elder L. Tom Perry visited our campus and was asked the following question by a faculty member: \"Elder Perry, what do you see as the looming storm clouds on the horizon about which we should know so we can better teach and prepare the young people of the Church?\" With no hesitation his answer was, \"Worldliness.\" The next question: \"What can we do, Elder Perry, to best help the young people combat worldliness?\" His answer: \"Help them prepare to worship properly in the temple.\"</p>\n<p>As you are well aware, we have devotional speakers every Tuesday&mdash;many of whom are emeritus General Authorities or Brethren who have been released after serving in the Second Quorum of the Seventy. A significant number of those Brethren, after being released as General Authorities, have served as temple presidents. As Sister Bednar and I host these Brethren, I ask each one of them this question: \"What did you learn serving in the temple that you wish you had better known or understood or appreciated when you were a General Authority?\" I have asked that question to many of the Brethren, and the consistency of their answers is striking! The following response by Elder J. Ballard Washburn is representative of so many of the answers I have received:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have come to better and more fully understand the protection available in the temple and through our covenants. I have come to better and more fully understand what it means to make an acceptable offering of temple worship. There is a difference between church-attending, tithe-paying members who occasionally rush into the temple to go through a session and those members who faithfully and consistently worship in the temple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Brothers and sisters, please remember that penetrating statement by Elder Washburn: \"&hellip;the protection available in the temple and through our covenants.\" I pray that we will begin to understand the significance of what was announced last December. The Rexburg temple will contribute to a potent and powerfully protected place of preparation for disciples of Christ who will be an influence for good all over the earth.</p>\n<h3>Factor #3: BYU&ndash;Idaho is surrounded by strong stakes of Zion.</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stakes are established as places of refuge and protection. Please turn with me to Doctrine and Covenants 115:5&ndash;6:</p>\n<p>Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations;</p>\n<p>And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please consider that during your tenure as a student at Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho, you also are a member of a stake of Zion. We have on this campus at the present time more than 70 wards organized into 7 stakes, and the protection promised in the verses we just read applies specifically to you. Additionally, in the surrounding city of Rexburg and in the neighboring communities of Southeastern Idaho are additional strong stakes of Zion. Truly we are blessed to reside in an area of such spiritual stability and strength.</p>\n<p>Your experiences and service in the stakes of Zion on this campus contribute in important ways to your preparation as a disciple of the Savior. Each of you will learn lessons here that will bless you and those you influence throughout your entire life.</p>\n<h2>Unparalleled Spiritual Resources</h2>\n<p>Brothers and sisters, consider the spiritual strength and power that are available in a single location where we find (1) a temple of learning, i.e., this institution; (2) a House of the Lord; and (3) strong stakes of Zion on campus and in Rexburg and in the surrounding communities. I only know of four places which the Lord has so prepared: Provo, Utah; Laie, Hawaii; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Rexburg, Idaho. And with the opportunity and privilege to study and learn here come a tremendous responsibility.</p>\n<p>I am fully aware that not all young people in the Church can or want to attend a Church-sponsored institution of higher education. And I certainly am not suggesting that these institutions are the only places where latter-day disciples are prepared and tutored and trained. Ultimately, the best Disciple Preparation Center is located within the walls of our own homes. Nevertheless, these institutions do have an important role to play today in the building of the kingdom of God on the earth.</p>\n<p>In the midst of an increasing downpour of devilish devastation across the earth, you are blessed to be here at one of the Lord's Disciple Preparation Centers. BYU&ndash;Idaho is not just a university. You are not merely university students. Studying here involves much more than taking tests and performing well in academic classes&mdash;although your academic development and performance truly are important. But there are essential lessons to be learned and preparations to be made at this DPC by the Lord's latter-day disciples. Let me suggest three primary lessons I hope every student will take away from his or her experience at this Disciple Preparation Center that we call Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho.</p>\n<h3>DPC Lesson #1</h3>\n<p>A disciple's faith is focused upon the Son of God. Brothers and sisters, the first principle of the gospel is not simply faith; rather, the first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Saving faith centers in the Savior and through Him in the Father (see Bruce R. McConkie, A New Witness for the Articles of Faith, p. 164). The faith of a true disciple is focused upon and rooted in the Savior and Redeemer, even the Lord Jesus Christ. As we read in Hebrews 12:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>DPC Lesson #2</h3>\n<p>A disciple recognizes that faith in the Savior is a spiritual gift and appropriately seeks for that gift in his or her life. Faith is not a trait to be developed or a reward to be earned. Rather, it is a gift we receive from God. Scriptural synonyms for faith include trust, confidence, and reliance. Thus, the spiritual gift of faith enables us to trust in Christ and to have confidence in His power to cleanse, to renew, to redeem, and to strengthen us. Faith means we are beginning to rely upon His merits, mercy, and grace (2 Nephi 2:8; 31:19; Moroni 6:4). Indeed, you and I have a responsibility to properly seek after this gift; and we must do all that we can do to qualify for the gift of faith. Ultimately, however, the gift is bestowed upon us by a loving and caring God. Elder James E. Talmage indicated in his classic book The Articles of Faith that faith is a gift from God.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though within the reach of all who diligently strive to gain it, faith is nevertheless a divine gift [and can be obtained only from God (see Matthew 16:17; John 6:44, 65; Ephesians 2:8; 1 Corinthians 12:9; Romans 12:3; Moroni 10:11)]. As is fitting for so priceless a pearl, it is given to those only who show by their sincerity that they are worthy of it, and who give promise of abiding by its dictates.</p>\n<p>&hellip; No compulsion is used in bringing men to a knowledge of God; yet, as fast as we open our hearts to the influences of righteousness, the faith that leads to life eternal will be given us of our Father. (The Articles of Faith, p. 107)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>President Joseph F. Smith also has taught:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Faith is always a gift of God to man, which is obtained by obedience, as all other blessings are. (Gospel Doctrine, p. 212)</p>\n<p>&hellip; faith does not come without works; faith does not come without obedience to the commandments of God. (Conference Report, October 1903, p. 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Young people of your age can and will and do receive this supernal gift. You need not be called to a visible or responsible position in the Church, and you do not have to be \"old\" to qualify for this gift. An 18-year-old disciple at BYU&ndash;Idaho can and should be blessed with great faith in the Savior.</p>\n<h3>DPC Lesson #3</h3>\n<p>A disciple's faith in the Savior and spiritual preparation dispel fear. Brothers and sisters, we live in troubled and turbulent times. The days described in Doctrine and Covenants 45:26 are indeed the days in which we now find ourselves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them&hellip;</p>\n<p>And President Boyd K. Packer recently put present world conditions into perspective for all of us:</p>\n<p>The world is spiraling downward at an ever-quickening pace. I am sorry to tell you that it will not get better.</p>\n<p>&hellip; I know of nothing in the history of the Church or in the history of the world to compare with our present circumstances. Nothing happened in Sodom and Gomorrah which exceeds in wickedness and depravity that which surrounds us now.</p>\n<p>Words of profanity, vulgarity, and blasphemy are heard everywhere. Unspeakable wickedness and perversion were once hidden in dark places; now they are in the open, even accorded legal protection.</p>\n<p>At Sodom and Gomorrah these things were localized. Now they are spread across the world, and they are among us. (<em>The One Pure Defense</em>, Address to CES Religious Educators, 6 February 2004, p. 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such descriptions may cause the hearts of some men and women to fail them. But as the Lord states, \"&hellip;my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved&hellip;\" (Doctrine and Covenants 45:32). Protected by \"&hellip;the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked\" (Doctrine and Covenants 27:17) and prepared with the \"&hellip;gospel of peace&hellip;\" (Doctrine and Covenants 27:16), the Lord's disciples will not fear. Precisely because such disciples are prepared, they shall not fear (see Doctrine and Covenants 38:30).</p>\n<p>Brothers and sisters, we are blessed to be in a special place&mdash;a Disciple Preparation Center&mdash;and to be engaged at a pivotal time in an essential work. As disciples we have important lessons to learn; we have an eternally important work to do. And in these tumultuous times, we will follow the Master.</p>\n<p>I conclude with a teaching by the Prophet Joseph Smith that I consider to be the latter-day disciple's mission statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done. (Statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Wentworth Letter, written March 1, 1842. See History of the Church, Vol. 4, p. 540)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I testify and witness that God the Eternal Father lives and that Jesus is the Christ. He lives. I know He lives. May each of us use to the fullest the opportunities we have at this Disciple Preparation Center to learn of Him, to learn from Him, and to follow Him. The supernal promise contained in section 19 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 23, is ever before us: \"Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.\" In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- end #article --></div>\n<script src=\"Web%20Files/course.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>"],

Christensen</p>\n<p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> <em>When the members of the class of 2010 entered business school, the economy was strong and their post-graduation ambitions could be limitless. Just a few weeks later, the economy went into a tailspin. They've spent the past two years re-calibrating their worldview and their definition of success.</em></p>\n<p><em>The students seem highly aware of how the world has changed (as the sampling of views in this article shows). In the spring, Harvard Business School's graduating class asked HBS professor Clay Christensen to address them&mdash;but not on how to apply his principles and thinking to their post-HBS careers. The students wanted to know how to apply them to their personal lives. He shared with them a set of guidelines that have helped him find meaning in his own life. Though Christensen's thinking comes from his deep religious faith, we believe that these are strategies anyone can use. And so we asked him to share them with the readers of HBR. To learn more about Christensen's work, visit his HBR Author Page.</em></p>\n<p>Before I published \"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" I got a call from Andrew Grove, then the chairman of Intel. He had read one of my early papers about disruptive technology, and he asked if I could talk to his direct reports and explain my research and what it implied for Intel. Excited, I flew to Silicon Valley and showed up at the appointed time, only to have Grove say, \"Look, stuff has happened. We have only 10 minutes for you. Tell us what your model of disruption means for Intel.\" I said that I couldn't&mdash;that I needed a full 30 minutes to explain the model, because only with it as context would any comments about Intel make sense. 10 minutes into my explanation, Grove interrupted: \"Look, I've got your model. Just tell us what it means for Intel.\"</p>\n<p>I insisted that I needed 10 more minutes to describe how the process of disruption had worked its way through a very different industry, steel, so that he and his team could understand how disruption worked. I told the story of how Nucor and other steel minimills had begun by attacking the lowest end of the market&mdash;steel reinforcing bars, or rebar&mdash;and later moved up toward the high end, undercutting the traditional steel mills.</p>\n<p>When I finished the minimill story, Grove said, \"OK, I get it. What it means for Intel is&hellip;,\" and then went on to articulate what would become the company's strategy for going to the bottom of the market to launch the Celeron processor.</p>\n<p>I've thought about that a million times since. If I had been suckered into telling Andy Grove what he should think about the microprocessor business, I'd have been killed. But instead of telling him what to think, I taught him how to think and then he reached what I felt was the correct decision on his own.</p>\n<p>That experience had a profound influence on me. When people ask what I think they should do, I rarely answer their question directly. Instead, I run the question aloud through one of my models. I'll describe how the process in the model worked its way through an industry quite different from their own. And then, more often than not, they'll say, \"OK, I get it.\" And they'll answer their own question more insightfully than I could have.</p>\n<p>My class at HBS is structured to help my students understand what good management theory is and how it is built. To that backbone I attach different models or theories that help students think about the various dimensions of a general manager's job in stimulating innovation and growth. In each session we look at one company through the lenses of those theories&mdash;using them to explain how the company got into its situation and to examine what managerial actions will yield the needed results.</p>\n<p>On the last day of class, I ask my students to turn those theoretical lenses on themselves, to find cogent answers to three questions: First, how can I be sure that I'll be happy in my career? Second, how can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse and my family become an enduring source of happiness? Third, how can I be sure I'll stay out of jail? Though the last question sounds lighthearted, it's not. Two of the 32 people in my Rhodes scholar class spent time in jail. Jeff Skilling of Enron fame was a classmate of mine at HBS. These were good guys but something in their lives sent them off in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>As the students discuss the answers to these questions, I open my own life to them as a case study of sorts, to illustrate how they can use the theories from our course to guide their life decisions.</p>\n<p>One of the theories that gives great insight on the first question&mdash;how to be sure we find happiness in our careers&mdash;is from Frederick Herzberg, who asserts that the powerful motivator in our lives isn't money; it's the opportunity to learn, grow in responsibilities, contribute to others, and be recognized for achievements. I tell the students about a vision of sorts I had while I was running the company I founded before becoming an academic. In my mind's eye I saw one of my managers leave for work one morning with a relatively strong level of self-esteem. Then I pictured her driving home to her family 10 hours later, feeling unappreciated, frustrated, underutilized, and demeaned. I imagined how profoundly her lowered self-esteem affected the way she interacted with her children. The vision in my mind then fast-forwarded to another day, when she drove home with greater self-esteem&mdash;feeling that she had learned a lot, been recognized for achieving valuable things, and played a significant role in the success of some important initiatives. I then imagined how positively that affected her as a spouse and a parent. My conclusion: Management is the most noble of professions if it's practiced well. No other occupation offers as many ways to help others learn and grow, take responsibility and be recognized for achievement, and contribute to the success of a team. More and more MBA students come to school thinking that a career in business means buying, selling, and investing in companies. That's unfortunate. Doing deals doesn't yield the deep rewards that come from building up people.</p>\n<p>I want students to leave my classroom knowing that.</p>\n<h2>Create a Strategy for Your Life</h2>\n<p>A theory that is helpful in answering the second question&mdash;How can I ensure that my relationship with my family proves to be an enduring source of happiness?&mdash;concerns how strategy is defined and implemented. Its primary insight is that a company's strategy is determined by the types of initiatives that management invests in. If a company's resource allocation process is not managed masterfully, what emerges from it can be very different from what management intended. Because companies decision-making systems are designed to steer investments to initiatives that offer the most tangible and immediate returns, companies shortchange investments in initiatives that are crucial to their long-term strategies.</p>\n<p>Over the years I've watched the fates of my HBS classmates from 1979 unfold; I've seen more and more of them come to reunions unhappy, divorced, and alienated from their children. I can guarantee you that not a single one of them graduated with the deliberate strategy of getting divorced and raising children who would become estranged from them. And yet a shocking number of them implemented that strategy. The reason? They didn't keep the purpose of their lives front and center as they decided how to spend their time, talents, and energy.</p>\n<p>It's quite startling that a significant fraction of the 900 students that HBS draws each year from the world's best have given little thought to the purpose of their lives. I tell the students that HBS might be one of their last chances to reflect deeply on that question. If they think that they'll have more time and energy to reflect later, they're nuts, because life only gets more demanding: You take on a mortgage; you're working 70 hours a week; you have a spouse and children.</p>\n<p>For me, having a clear purpose in my life has been essential. But it was something I had to think long and hard about before I understood it. When I was a Rhodes scholar, I was in a very demanding academic program, trying to cram an extra year's worth of work into my time at Oxford. I decided to spend an hour every night reading, thinking, and praying about why God put me on this earth. That was a very challenging commitment to keep, because every hour I spent doing that, I wasn't studying applied econometrics. I was conflicted about whether I could really afford to take that time away from my studies, but I stuck with it and ultimately figured out the purpose of my life.</p>\n<p>Had I instead spent that hour each day learning the latest techniques for mastering the problems of auto-correlation in regression analysis, I would have badly misspent my life. I apply the tools of econometrics a few times a year, but I apply my knowledge of the purpose of my life every day. It's the single most useful thing I've ever learned. I promise my students that if they take the time to figure out their life purpose, they'll look back on it as the most important thing they discovered at HBS. If they don't figure it out, they will just sail off without a rudder and get buffeted in the very rough seas of life. Clarity about their purpose will trump knowledge of activity-based costing, balanced scorecards, core competence, disruptive innovation, the four Ps, and the five forces.</p>\n<p>My purpose grew out of my religious faith, but faith isn't the only thing that gives people direction. For example, one of my former students decided that his purpose was to bring honesty and economic prosperity to his country and to raise children who were as capably committed to this cause, and to each other, as he was. His purpose is focused on family and others&mdash;as mine is.</p>\n<p>The choice and successful pursuit of a profession is but one tool for achieving your purpose. But without a purpose, life can become hollow.</p>\n<h2>Allocate Your Resources</h2>\n<p>Your decisions about allocating your personal time, energy, and talent ultimately shape your life's strategy.</p>\n<p>I have a bunch of \"businesses\" that compete for these resources: I'm trying to have a rewarding relationship with my wife, raise great kids, contribute to my community, succeed in my career, contribute to my church, and so on. And I have exactly the same problem that a corporation does. I have a limited amount of time and energy and talent. How much do I devote to each of these pursuits?</p>\n<p>Allocation choices can make your life turn out to be very different from what you intended. Sometimes that's good: Opportunities that you never planned for emerge. But if you misinvest your resources, the outcome can be bad. As I think about my former classmates who inadvertently invested for lives of hollow unhappiness, I can't help believing that their troubles relate right back to a short-term perspective.</p>\n<p>When people who have a high need for achievement&mdash;and that includes all Harvard Business School graduates&mdash;have an extra half hour of time or an extra ounce of energy, they'll unconsciously allocate it to activities that yield the most tangible accomplishments. And our careers provide the most concrete evidence that we're moving forward. You ship a product, finish a design, complete a presentation, close a sale, teach a class, publish a paper, get paid, get promoted. In contrast, investing time and energy in your relationship with your spouse and children typically doesn't offer that same immediate sense of achievement. Kids misbehave every day. It's really not until 20 years down the road that you can put your hands on your hips and say, \"I raised a good son or a good daughter.\" You can neglect your relationship with your spouse, and on a day-to-day basis, it doesn't seem as if things are deteriorating. People who are driven to excel have this unconscious propensity to underinvest in their families and overinvest in their careers&mdash;even though intimate and loving relationships with their families are the most powerful and enduring source of happiness.</p>\n<p>If you study the root causes of business disasters, over and over you'll find this predisposition toward endeavors that offer immediate gratification. If you look at personal lives through that lens, you'll see the same stunning and sobering pattern: people allocating fewer and fewer resources to the things they would have once said mattered most.</p>\n<h2>Create a Culture</h2>\n<p>There's an important model in our class called the Tools of Cooperation, which basically says that being a visionary manager isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's one thing to see into the foggy future with acuity and chart the course corrections that the company must make. But it's quite another to persuade employees who might not see the changes ahead to line up and work cooperatively to take the company in that new direction. Knowing what tools to wield to elicit the needed cooperation is a critical managerial skill.</p>\n<p>The theory arrays these tools along two dimensions&mdash;the extent to which members of the organization agree on what they want from their participation in the enterprise, and the extent to which they agree on what actions will produce the desired results. When there is little agreement on both axes, you have to use \"power tools\"&mdash;coercion, threats, punishment, and so on&mdash;to secure cooperation. Many companies start in this quadrant, which is why the founding executive team must play such an assertive role in defining what must be done and how. If employees' ways of working together to address those tasks succeed over and over, consensus begins to form. MIT's Edgar Schein has described this process as the mechanism by which a culture is built. Ultimately, people don't even think about whether their way of doing things yields success. They embrace priorities and follow procedures by instinct and assumption rather than by explicit decision&mdash;which means that they've created a culture. Culture, in compelling but unspoken ways, dictates the proven, acceptable methods by which members of the group address recurrent problems. And culture defines the priority given to different types of problems. It can be a powerful management tool.</p>\n<p>\"How can I be sure that my family becomes an enduring source of happiness?\" In using this model to address this question, &nbsp;my students quickly see that the simplest tools that parents can wield to elicit cooperation from children are power tools. But there comes a point during the teen years when power tools no longer work. At that point parents start wishing that they had begun working with their children at a very young age to build a culture at home in which children instinctively behave respectfully toward one another, obey their parents, and choose the right thing to do. Families have cultures, just as companies do. Those cultures can be built consciously or evolve inadvertently.</p>\n<p>If you want your kids to have strong self-esteem and confidence that they can solve hard problems, those qualities won't magically materialize in high school. You have to design them into your family's culture and you have to think about this very early on. Like employees, children build self-esteem by doing things that are hard and learning what works.</p>\n<h2>Avoid the \"Marginal Costs\" Mistake</h2>\n<p>We're taught in finance and economics that in evaluating alternative investments, we should ignore sunk and fixed costs, and instead base decisions on the marginal costs and marginal revenues that each alternative entails. We learn in our course that this doctrine biases companies to leverage what they have put in place to succeed in the past, instead of guiding them to create the capabilities they'll need in the future. If we knew the future would be exactly the same as the past, that approach would be fine. But if the future's different&mdash;and it almost always is&mdash;then it's the wrong thing to do.</p>\n<p>This theory addresses the third question I discuss with my students&mdash;how to live a life of integrity (stay out of jail).</p>\n<p>Unconsciously, we often employ the marginal cost doctrine in our personal lives when we choose between right and wrong. A voice in our head says, \"Look, I know that as a general rule, most people shouldn't do this. But in this particular extenuating circumstance, just this once, it's OK.\" The marginal cost of doing something wrong \"just this once\" always seems alluringly low.</p>\n<p>It suckers you in, and you don't ever look at where that path ultimately is headed and at the full costs that the choice entails.</p>\n<p>Justification for infidelity and dishonesty in all their manifestations lies in the marginal cost economics of \"just this once.\"</p>\n<p>I'd like to share a story about how I came to understand the potential damage of \"just this once\" in my own life. I played on the Oxford University varsity basketball team. We worked our tails off and finished the season undefeated. The guys on the team were the best friends I've ever had in my life. We got to the British equivalent of the NCAA tournament and made it to the final four. It turned out the championship game was scheduled to be played on a Sunday. I had made a personal commitment to God at age 16 that I would never play ball on Sunday. So I went to the coach and explained my problem. He was incredulous. My teammates were, too, because I was the starting center. Every one of the guys on the team came to me and said, \"You've got to play. Can't you break the rule just this one time?\"</p>\n<p>I'm a deeply religious man, so I went away and prayed about what I should do. I got a very clear feeling that I shouldn't break my commitment so I didn't play in the championship game.</p>\n<p>In many ways that was a small decision involving one of several thousand Sundays in my life. In theory, surely I could have crossed over the line just that one time and then not done it again. But looking back on it, resisting the temptation whose logic was \"In this extenuating circumstance, just this once, it's OK\" has proven to be one of the most important decisions of my life. Why? My life has been one unending stream of extenuating circumstances. Had I crossed the line that one time, I would have done it over and over in the years that followed.</p>\n<p>The lesson I learned from this is that it's easier to hold to your principles 100% of the time than it is to hold to them 98% of the time. If you give in to \"just this once,\" based on a marginal cost analysis, as some of my former classmates have done, you'll regret where you end up. You've got to define for yourself what you stand for and draw the line in a safe place.</p>\n<h2>Remember the Importance of Humility</h2>\n<p>I got this insight when I was asked to teach a class on humility at Harvard College. I asked all the students to describe the most humble person they knew. One characteristic of these humble people stood out: They had a high level of self-esteem. They knew who they were, and they felt good about who they were. We also decided that humility was defined not by self-deprecating behavior or attitudes but by the esteem with which you regard others. Good behavior flows naturally from that kind of humility. For example, you would never steal from someone, because you respect that person too much. You'd never lie to someone, either.</p>\n<p>It's crucial to take a sense of humility into the world. By the time you make it to a top graduate school, almost all your learning has come from people who are smarter and more experienced than you: parents, teachers, bosses. But once you've finished at Harvard Business School or any other top academic institution, the vast majority of people you'll interact with on a day-to-day basis may not be smarter than you. And if your attitude is that only smarter people have something to teach you, your learning opportunities will be very limited. But if you have a humble eagerness to learn something from everybody, your learning opportunities will be unlimited. Generally, you can be humble only if you feel really good about yourself and you want to help those around you feel really good about themselves, too. When we see people acting in an abusive, arrogant, or demeaning manner toward others, their behavior almost always is a symptom of their lack of self-esteem. They need to put someone else down to feel good about themselves.</p>\n<h2>Choose the Right Yardstick</h2>\n<p>This past year I was diagnosed with cancer and faced the possibility that my life would end sooner than I'd planned. Thankfully, it now looks as if I'll be spared. But the experience has given me important insight into my life.</p>\n<p>I have a pretty clear idea of how my ideas have generated enormous revenue for companies that have used my research; I know I've had a substantial impact. But as I've confronted this disease, it's been interesting to see how unimportant that impact is to me now. I've concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn't dollars but the individual people whose lives I've touched.</p>\n<p>I think that's the way it will work for us all. Don't worry about the level of individual prominence you have achieved; worry about the individuals you have helped become better people. This is my final recommendation: Think about the metric by which your life will be judged, and make a resolution to live every day so that in the end, your life will be judged a success.</p>\n<h2>The Class of 2010</h2>\n<p><em>\"I came to business school knowing exactly what I wanted to do and I'm leaving, choosing the exact opposite. I've worked in the private sector all my life, because everyone always told me that's where smart people are.

Money used to be number one in the job search. When you make a ton of money, you want more of it. Ironic thing. You start to forget what the drivers of happiness are and what things are really important. A lot of people on campus see money differently now. They think, 'What's the minimum I need to have, and what else drives my life'?instead of 'What's the place where I can get the maximum of both.''\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Patrick Chun,</strong> Harvard Business School, Class of 2010</p>\n<p><strong>His Plans:</strong> To join Bain Capital</p>\n<p><em>\"The financial crisis helped me realize that you have to do what you really love in life.
